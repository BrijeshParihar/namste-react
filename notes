test command : jest
imp -package.json is configuration for npm 
 bunlded()--> bundled (web, parcel etc  )
 npm install parcel -> get poarcel in our project. (if we can say without parcel our react app is just 
 skelton but parcel give muslse to out app .. hehehe)

 npm install -D parcel (-D)
 there are two types packagedev and normal
 dev just require for development only 
 -D define development 

 caret and tilde in package--- caret -- minor will update with version 
tilde- if major vwrsion

==========
React Elelment--- like dom element 
react.createElement ==> Object (when we render this object to on dom then its become html )

jSX- can esly merge html and js 

JSX is not html inside js .
JSX is like html syntax or SML like syntAx
we can create react element using JSX
JS engine olny understand - ecma-Script - ES6
code transpile before goes to js engine(its done by parcel-package Babel basicaaly do that)
Babel convert jSX code do that react or js can understand 

JSX-> createElement--> object ---> HTMLelement(render)
in jsx attribute in jsx as camael case 
in jsx in not in singsl line wrappe in ()

to do - bralet pair colorization 
//React Component
1) class based -- old based- no body use this on a days 
2) functional component -- new way

-- component start witg Capital letter 
React function component is just noraml js fuction which return JSX 
we can render using <component name />
adding component inside anather component is called component composition

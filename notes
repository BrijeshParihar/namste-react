npm- not fulll form - node package manager
npm is repository- has package 
npm init
test command : jest
imp -package.json is configuration for npm 
 bunlded()--> bundled (web, parcel etc  )
 npm install parcel -> get poarcel in our project. (if we can say without parcel our react app is just 
 skelton but parcel give muslse to out app .. hehehe)

 npm install -D parcel (-D)
 there are two types packagedev and normal
 dev just require for development only 
 -D define development 

 caret and tilde in package--- caret -- minor will update with version 
tilde- if major vwrsion 


--- 
transative deendency-- in aa package depend b paqckage -b depenede - c
node module - collection of package

----
npx  parcel index.html --> build and deploy on dev server
---> npx -x - execute 

npm i - here i is short form of install

==========
React Elelment--- like dom element 
react.createElement ==> Object (when we render this object to on dom then its become html )

jSX- can esly merge html and js 

JSX is not html inside js .
JSX is like html syntax or XML like syntAx
we can create react element using JSX
JS engine olny understand - ecma-Script - ES6
code transpile before goes to js engine(its done by parcel-package Babel basicaaly do that)
Babel convert jSX code do that react or js can understand 

JSX-> createElement--> object ---> HTMLelement(render)
in jsx attribute in jsx as camael case 
if jsx is not in singla line then wrap in  ()

to do - bralet pair colorization 
//React Component
1) class based -- old based- nobody use this on a days 
2) functional component -- new way

-- component start witg Capital letter 
React function component is just noraml js fuction which return JSX 
we can render using <component name />
adding component inside anather component is called component composition 


props- property(just argument of function )
when we need dynamically pass data to component then we will pass as in props .


-- config driven api 

map- pls add key .
never use index as key .
only use when no unique id available 


========================================
= $05
========================================

export  default - only one 

export named-just put export in front of data / import in {}


--react hook--

react is fast to maninpulate dom very fast.

state variable :- use state. 

react hook - just normal prebuild javascript fucntion 

two very imp hook 
1) useState() - superpowerful state variable - its maintaice the state of module
const [name,setname] = useState([])

we can modify this  name using second argument of usehook funcion 

Whenever usestate varibale is update then react re-render the component .
2) useEffect()


=====
reconciliation algo-  also called react fiber
virtual dom --> its just represnetation of actual dom (createElement return object)
nested object 

diff algo---find out diffrence b/w previou and new virtual dom 

read- acdlite -- rect fiber archetecture. 

==========================================================
= 06
==========================================================

USEEFFECT- 
TAKE TWO  argumnet fisrt call back fuinction , second depnedency.
FUNCTION CALL, CALL BACK FUNCTION AFTER THE RENDRING THE FUNCTION .

When ever state variable update, react triggers a reconcialation cycle(re-render the component)
reacr fiber has algo the recoliation old and new virtual dom. 


=================
07- 
=================

if useeffect without second argument then ueseffect called every time when our componenet render. but we can controll this by secont argument 

if denendency arrary is empty. then useeffect called on intial render of component .
if denpendency array value change then useeffect call.


======
Never use useState outside method body. usesTate hook is used to create local state varaible. 
try to useState at  top in side function body. 
not use inside if.else,condition, loop,fucntion. only in functional component. 


rafce: crwate component 

useRouteError-- give more info about error

when use router thaen never use ancher tag if we use then full page got loaded . 
instead of we use link and simpler like <a>.

Link is wrapepr over acher tag.

npm- not fulll form - node package manager
npm is repository- has package 
npm init
test command : jest
imp -package.json is configuration for npm 
 bunlded()--> bundled (web, parcel etc  )
 npm install parcel -> get poarcel in our project. (if we can say without parcel our react app is just 
 skelton but parcel give muslse to out app .. hehehe)

 npm install -D parcel (-D)
 there are two types packagedev and normal
 dev just require for development only 
 -D define development 

 caret and tilde in package--- caret -- minor will update with version 
tilde- if major vwrsion 


--- 
transative deendency-- in aa package depend b paqckage -b depenede - c
node module - collection of package

----
npx  parcel index.html --> build and deploy on dev server
---> npx -x - execute 

npm i - here i is short form of install

==========
React Elelment--- like dom element 
react.createElement ==> Object (when we render this object to on dom then its become html )

jSX- can esly merge html and js 

JSX is not html inside js .
JSX is like html syntax or SML like syntAx
we can create react element using JSX
JS engine olny understand - ecma-Script - ES6
code transpile before goes to js engine(its done by parcel-package Babel basicaaly do that)
Babel convert jSX code do that react or js can understand 

JSX-> createElement--> object ---> HTMLelement(render)
in jsx attribute in jsx as camael case 
in jsx in not in singsl line wrappe in ()

to do - bralet pair colorization 
//React Component
1) class based -- old based- no body use this on a days 
2) functional component -- new way

-- component start witg Capital letter 
React function component is just noraml js fuction which return JSX 
we can render using <component name />
adding component inside anather component is called component composition 


props- property(just argument of function )
when we need dynamically pass data to component then we will pass as in props .


-- config driven api 

map- pls add key .
never use kindex as key .
only use when no unique id available 


========================================
= $05
========================================

export  default - only one 

export named-just put export in front of data / import in {}


--react hook--

react isfast to maninpulate dom very fast.

state variable :- use state. 

react hook - just normal prebuild javascript fucntion 

two very imp hook 
1) useState() - superpowerful state variable - its maintaice the state of module
const [name,setname] = useState([])

we can modify this secont argument of usehook funcion 
Whenever usestate varibale is update then react re-render the component .
2) useEffect()
